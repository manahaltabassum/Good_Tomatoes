### **What is our website?**
Our website combines books and movies to give you the best of both worlds. Why go and look up movies and books separately when you can have them all in once place? Our website allows you to do just that. If both a movie and book exists for a certain title, you can now have its reviews show up in one place. Let's say you do only want to look up a movie or only a book. Guess what? You can even do that. Now when you're sitting around and don't know whether you want to read a book or watch a movie you can just look up both their reviews here and make up your mind.

### **What APIs were utilized?**
Our group used the Goodreads API and NYTimes Movie Reviews API to bring you this website.

### **How to launch the website:**
1. Activate your virtual environment.
2. Ensure that flask, xmltodict, and requests have been installed into the virtual environment.
3. Ensure that key.py is at the root directory.
4. Type in '''python app.py''' in the terminal to run the site and enjoy!
